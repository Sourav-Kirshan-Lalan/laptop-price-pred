# üíª Laptop Price Predictor ‚Äî A Machine Learning Web App

A data-driven machine learning project that predicts the **price of a laptop** based on its specifications. This web application uses a trained regression model and is built with **Flask** and **Scikit-learn**, and deployed via **Railway**.

**Live Demo**: [Laptop Price Predictor Web App](https://web-production-5d5f.up.railway.app/)

## Objective

To build an end-to-end machine learning web app that:
- Predicts laptop prices based on user-input features.
- Helps buyers, sellers, or tech enthusiasts understand fair pricing.
- Demonstrates a complete ML pipeline ‚Äî from data preprocessing to deployment.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Loaded raw laptop dataset.
- Handled missing values and formatting issues.
- Converted binary attributes (`Touchscreen`, `IPS`) to numerical (0/1).

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted screen size from resolution.
- Computed **PPI (Pixels Per Inch)** as a derived feature.
- Converted `HDD`, `SSD` storage columns to integers.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Identified influential features on price.

### 4. Model Building
- Tested multiple regression models including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
- Evaluated using:
  - R¬≤ Score
  - Cross-validation

### 5. Flask Integration
- Created an interactive web form using Jinja2 templating.
- Integrated the trained model to make real-time predictions from user inputs.
