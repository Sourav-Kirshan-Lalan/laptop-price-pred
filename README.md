# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Predictor â€” A Machine Learning Project

## Project Explanation

The **Laptop Price Predictor** is a data-driven machine learning project designed to estimate the price of laptops based on various hardware and brand specifications. The primary goal is to provide users â€” whether buyers, sellers, or analysts â€” with a tool that can predict the fair market price of a laptop configuration using supervised learning techniques.

## Objective

To build a regression model that accurately predicts laptop prices from a dataset of laptop specifications by following a complete machine learning pipeline â€” from preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Loaded raw laptop data.
- Handled missing values and inconsistent formats.
- Converted binary attributes (like touchscreen, IPS) into 0/1.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted screen size from resolution.
- Converted storage columns (HDD/SSD) to numeric.
- Created new features like PPI (pixels per inch) for better model accuracy.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized relationships between features and price.
- Checked feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.

### 4. **Model Building**
- Tested multiple regression models including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
- Performed train/test split and evaluated with:
  - RÂ² Score
  - Cross-validation

### 5. **Prediction**
- Final model can predict prices based on new input features.
